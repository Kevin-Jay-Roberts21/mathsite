  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Notes From The Great Conversation</h2>
  
  <div style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">
  	<p>I see the Great Conversation as a preface to the Great Books collection. A lot of Robert Hutchins words inspired me to continue with the Great Books collection in reading The Iliad of Homer. The main thing I took away from reading this book was in Chapter VI: Education for All. Once Hutchins established that reading the Great Books is "the best education for the best", he went on to debate whether or not everybody can get this kind of education. We are all different, thus we all learn differently, so this begs the question: Why should we all be raised with the same educational methods?</p>
    <p>Imagine a little boy playing with legos on the floor. You go up to him and ask, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" To which he hesitates and replies, "I don't know." After pursuing the boy for a discrete answer he finally says, "I want to build buildings." Now imagine an education where the boy is placed in a contruction-based school where he learns everything he needs to know about building sufficient apartment buildings. Later the boy decides he wants to learn something else. He quits his construction job and starts studying biology from square one, because now he decides he wants to become a botanist.</p>
    <p>The story of this little boy is the very reason why we don't have an educational system tied to spcific occupations. Humans are very much people of change. We change our opinions all the time and ecspecially in what we want to learn. Thus, our educational system must consist of the very basics of art, science, history, and literature in an attempt to broaden the little boy's outlook. This system can prepare our little boy with a basic understanding of these topics so that he may switch from building houses, to planting a garden, to writing a book, etc. with ease.</p>
    <p>The Great Books collection is exactly what this little boy needs when he grows up. After skimming over The Great Conversation (book 1 of the Great Books), this idea of a general education is what stuck with me the most. The Great Books contains Imaginative Literature (books binded in yellow), History and Social Science (binded in blue), Mathematics and Nature Sciences (binded in green), and Philosophy and Theology (binded in red). A grand collection of topics to learn and read about. These books, I beileve in theory, will grant me the best education mankind has to offer. For it is not a learning unique subject that gives us happiness, but learning itself.</p>
