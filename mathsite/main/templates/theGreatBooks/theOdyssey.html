    <p><b>BOOK I</b></p>
    
    <p>Our story begins concerning Ulysses. After the battle of Troy, all the other soliders made it safely home except for Ulysses who was detained by the goddess Calypso (who wants to marry him) on an island in the middle of the sea. All the gods pittied him, except for Neptune (because Ulysses had blinded the eye of Neptune's son: Polyphemus, king of the Cyclopes), and decided that it's time he escape the island and return home to his wife and son.</p>
    <p>In their decision, Minerva went down from Olympus in the form of Mentes, chief of the Taphians and an old friend of Ulysses and visited Telemachus. Additionally, Minerva told Mercury to tell Calypso that the gods have made up their mind, that Ulysses should return home.</p>
    <p>During Minerva's visit, they spoke amoungst many other men who ate freely at Telemachus' house, for they were suitors to Telemachus' mother. Telemachus was worried that without Ulysses, the suitors will make havoc of his estate and then with himself. Thus, Minerva convinced Telemachus to summon at least 20 men to leave in the morning to search for his father. Telemachus had the feeling all along that he was speaking to a goddess and not Mentes himself.</p>

    <p><b>Book II</b></p>

    <p>Telemachus woke the next morning and spoke to the people saying that he was most aggreived by the absence of his father. Telemachus also exclaimed his frustration at the suitors for eating all his food, drinking his wine, and making themselves at home in his own estate. The suitors (specifically Antinous) said that it's Telemachus' mother to blame because Antinous claims she said that she thinks Ulysses is dead and that she will consider a suitor after she finishes making a pall for the hero Laertes. It's been 3 years since she started (almost 4 now) and she's not done yet. This is because during the night she undoes her work and starts again in the morning.</p>
    <p>Antinous and Telemachus argued the matter and suddenly two eagles flew down from the heavens (sent by Jove) who fought each other fiercely. Halitherses took it as an omen that Ulysses should soon return, but Eurymachus said it was all rubbish and told the old man to go home. Telemachus made a deal with the suitors, that they should give him 20 men and he'd sial away in search of his father. If he finds that his father is dead, then he'd allow a suitor to marry his mother, otherwise, the suitors are to leave his estate alone.</p>
    <p>Telemachus then prayed to Minerva for help and Minerva answered. She provided him a ship with 20 volunteers from the village. Telemachus then spoke to the nurse Euryclea about his leaving. None of the other maids, or even Telemachus' mother, knew of his leaving. Finally, Telemachus set sail with the men in search for his father.</p>

    <p><b>Book III</b></p>

    <p>Telemachus, Minerva, and the rest of the men arrived to Pylos, city of Neleus. Nestor greeted them and Minerva encouraged Telemachus to speak directly to wise Nestor and ask him where he might find his father. Nestor gave them food and drink and told Telemachus the story of when he last saw Ulysses.</p>
    <p>Nestor explained to Telemachus that when the Achaeans were at war with the Trojans, some of the men decided to leave Troy and sail home. Agamemenon, the King of the Achaean army, did not approve of this and wanted all the men to stay. As some of the men were sailing home, some turned back (including Ulysses), to make their "peace" with Agamemnon. Nestor did not turn back and therefore did not have any fortunate information about Telemachus' father Ulysses. Additionally, Nester and Ulysses talked more of the death of Agamemnon (killed by Aegisthus).</p>
    <p>Nestor gave Telemachus further advice to not stay away from home for too long because the suitors may take everything from him. Nestor also told Telemachus to speak with Menelaus, for Menelaus just got back from a long voyage and might have information about Ulysses. Nestor gave Telemachus horse transportation, provided by Nestor's sons and they rode out to visit Menelaus.</p>
  </p>

  <p><b>Book IV</b></p>

  <p>Pisistratus and Telemachus arrived at Lacedaemon and drove straight to the house of Menelaus. At the time, Menelaus was celebrating the wedding of his son and his daughter. Even with the disruption of Telemachus' arrival, kind Menelaus still welcomed them in and gave them food and drink. Before Telemachus could say anything about who he was or why he came, Menelaus spoke of how he missed Ulysses, and it brought tears to Telemachus' eyes. After this Menelaus soon found out who Telemachus was. They all wept when they spoke more of Ulysses.</p>
  <p>Helen, wife to Menelaus, put a drug in the wine which restricts the shedding of tears to all who partake of it. They reminisced more about Ulysses until they finally went to bed. In the morning, Telemachus finally told Menelaus the reason of his visit; to find his father. Menelaus then told Telemachus a story of when the gods detained him in Egypt. Idothea, a sea-goddess, told Menelaus to speak with Proteus to ask for help in escaping the island (Pharos). Menelaus did so and further asked Proteus about where his other comrades were (the warriors who fought in the Trojan war). Proteus told Menelaus that many had died and further told him that Ulysses was trapped by Calypso on an island. When Telemachus heard of this from Menelaus, he made further plans to save his father.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, back in Ithaca, Antinous and Eurymachus found out that Telemachus had left in search of his father and grew very angry. They, by no means, would let Telemachus return. They armored themselves, along with 20 other men, and sailed to Asteris (an island between Ithaca and Samos), and placed themselves ready to ambush Telemachus should he return. Penelope also found out about Telemachus' and wept. Minerva sent a vision to Penelope to comfort her, saying that her son has the gods on his side and will return to Ithaca.</p>

  <p><b>Book V</b></p>

  <p>The gods discussed the state of Ulysses and Minerva, more than anyone else, said he should be set free from Calypso. Jove told Mercury to send a message to Calypso; that the gods have decided Ulysses should return home. Mercury let Calypso know and Calypso grew very angry. With more persuasion, however, Calypso accepted.</p>
  <p>Calypso went to Ulysses by the sea shore and told him that she was going to set him free. Ulysses thought there was some trickery behind her plan but she was sincere. She gave him an axe to cut wood and craft a raft. Finally, Ulysses said that he would not leave unless he knew Neptune would not destory his raft in the rough sea. Calypso said he would be safe, but it was not so. When Ulysses set off, Neptune found out and destroyed his raft in anger. Ulysses was forced to swim. Ino, a sea-goddess, pitied Ulysses and gave him her enchanted veil which allowed him to "come to no harm" as long as he wears it. With this Ulysses continued swimming (for 2 days) until he finally reached the land of the Phaeacians. He threw the veil back into the water to return it to Ino. Very very weakly, he made for the woods, found shelter and covered himself with leaves.</p>

  <p><b>Book VI</b></p>

  <p>As Ulysses slept, covered in leaves, Minerva ran off to the city of the Phaeacians, taking the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's daughter (a friend of Nausicaa's). Minerva gave Nausicaa a dream that made her decide to wash her clothes in the morning. Nausicaa was soon to be married (the groom has not been decided yet) and she chose to wash up her and her family's clothes in preparation. She asked her father if she could take the mules, the clothes and the maids with her to wash down by the river, near to where Ulysses slept. Her father accepted her request.</p>
  <p>When she got down to the river, her and the maids woke up Ulysses. Ulysses kindly asked for help from the girls and indeed the girls aided weary Ulysses. They gave him food, drink, clothes and oils to wash himself with. Nausciaa and the other maids found Ulysses very attractive and thought that the gods might've sent him. Finally, Nausciaa brought Ulysses into the outskirts of the town into a rich garden where he could rest while Nausciaa went to talk to her father about Ulysses.</p>
