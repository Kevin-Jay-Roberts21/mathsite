    <p><b>BOOK I</b></p>
    
    <p>Our story begins concerning Ulysses. After the battle of Troy, all the other soliders made it safely home except for Ulysses who was detained by the goddess Calypso (who wants to marry him) on an island in the middle of the sea. All the gods pittied him, except for Neptune (because Ulysses had blinded the eye of Neptune's son: Polyphemus, king of the Cyclopes), and decided that it's time he escape the island and return home to his wife and son.</p>
    <p>In their decision, Minerva went down from Olympus in the form of Mentes, chief of the Taphians and an old friend of Ulysses and visited Telemachus. Additionally, Minerva told Mercury to tell Calypso that the gods have made up their mind, that Ulysses should return home.</p>
    <p>During Minerva's visit, they spoke amoungst many other men who ate freely at Telemachus' house, for they were suitors to Telemachus' mother. Telemachus was worried that without Ulysses, the suitors will make havoc of his estate and then with himself. Thus, Minerva convinced Telemachus to summon at least 20 men to leave in the morning to search for his father. Telemachus had the feeling all along that he was speaking to a goddess and not Mentes himself.</p>

    <p><b>Book II</b></p>

    <p>Telemachus woke the next morning and spoke to the people saying that he was most aggreived by the absence of his father. Telemachus also exclaimed his frustration at the suitors for eating all his food, drinking his wine, and making themselves at home in his own estate. The suitors (specifically Antinous) said that it's Telemachus' mother to blame because Antinous claims she said that she thinks Ulysses is dead and that she will consider a suitor after she finishes making a pall for the hero Laertes. It's been 3 years since she started (almost 4 now) and she's not done yet. This is because during the night she undoes her work and starts again in the morning.</p>
    <p>Antinous and Telemachus argued the matter and suddenly two eagles flew down from the heavens (sent by Jove) who fought each other fiercely. Halitherses took it as an omen that Ulysses should soon return, but Eurymachus said it was all rubbish and told the old man to go home. Telemachus made a deal with the suitors, that they should give him 20 men and he'd sial away in search of his father. If he finds that his father is dead, then he'd allow a suitor to marry his mother, otherwise, the suitors are to leave his estate alone.</p>
    <p>Telemachus then prayed to Minerva for help and Minerva answered. She provided him a ship with 20 volunteers from the village. Telemachus then spoke to the nurse Euryclea about his leaving. None of the other maids, or even Telemachus' mother, knew of his leaving. Finally, Telemachus set sail with the men in search for his father.</p>

    <p><b>Book III</b></p>

    <p>Telemachus, Minerva, and the rest of the men arrived to Pylos, city of Neleus. Nestor greeted them and Minerva encouraged Telemachus to speak directly to wise Nestor and ask him where he might find his father. Nestor gave them food and drink and told Telemachus the story of when he last saw Ulysses.</p>
    <p>Nestor explained to Telemachus that when the Achaeans were at war with the Trojans, some of the men decided to leave Troy and sail home. Agamemenon, the King of the Achaean army, did not approve of this and wanted all the men to stay. As some of the men were sailing home, some turned back (including Ulysses), to make their "peace" with Agamemnon. Nestor did not turn back and therefore did not have any fortunate information about Telemachus' father Ulysses. Additionally, Nester and Ulysses talked more of the death of Agamemnon (killed by Aegisthus).</p>
    <p>Nestor gave Telemachus further advice to not stay away from home for too long because the suitors may take everything from him. Nestor also told Telemachus to speak with Menelaus, for Menelaus just got back from a long voyage and might have information about Ulysses. Nestor gave Telemachus horse transportation, provided by Nestor's sons and they rode out to visit Menelaus.</p>
  </p>

  <p><b>Book IV</b></p>

  <p>Pisistratus and Telemachus arrived at Lacedaemon and drove straight to the house of Menelaus. At the time, Menelaus was celebrating the wedding of his son and his daughter. Even with the disruption of Telemachus' arrival, kind Menelaus still welcomed them in and gave them food and drink. Before Telemachus could say anything about who he was or why he came, Menelaus spoke of how he missed Ulysses, and it brought tears to Telemachus' eyes. After this Menelaus soon found out who Telemachus was. They all wept when they spoke more of Ulysses.</p>
  <p>Helen, wife to Menelaus, put a drug in the wine which restricts the shedding of tears to all who partake of it. They reminisced more about Ulysses until they finally went to bed. In the morning, Telemachus finally told Menelaus the reason of his visit; to find his father. Menelaus then told Telemachus a story of when the gods detained him in Egypt. Idothea, a sea-goddess, told Menelaus to speak with Proteus to ask for help in escaping the island (Pharos). Menelaus did so and further asked Proteus about where his other comrades were (the warriors who fought in the Trojan war). Proteus told Menelaus that many had died and further told him that Ulysses was trapped by Calypso on an island. When Telemachus heard of this from Menelaus, he made further plans to save his father.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, back in Ithaca, Antinous and Eurymachus found out that Telemachus had left in search of his father and grew very angry. They, by no means, would let Telemachus return. They armored themselves, along with 20 other men, and sailed to Asteris (an island between Ithaca and Samos), and placed themselves ready to ambush Telemachus should he return. Penelope also found out about Telemachus' and wept. Minerva sent a vision to Penelope to comfort her, saying that her son has the gods on his side and will return to Ithaca.</p>

  <p><b>Book V</b></p>

  <p>The gods discussed the state of Ulysses and Minerva, more than anyone else, said he should be set free from Calypso. Jove told Mercury to send a message to Calypso; that the gods have decided Ulysses should return home. Mercury let Calypso know and Calypso grew very angry. With more persuasion, however, Calypso accepted.</p>
  <p>Calypso went to Ulysses by the sea shore and told him that she was going to set him free. Ulysses thought there was some trickery behind her plan but she was sincere. She gave him an axe to cut wood and craft a raft. Finally, Ulysses said that he would not leave unless he knew Neptune would not destory his raft in the rough sea. Calypso said he would be safe, but it was not so. When Ulysses set off, Neptune found out and destroyed his raft in anger. Ulysses was forced to swim. Ino, a sea-goddess, pitied Ulysses and gave him her enchanted veil which allowed him to "come to no harm" as long as he wears it. With this Ulysses continued swimming (for 2 days) until he finally reached the land of the Phaeacians. He threw the veil back into the water to return it to Ino. Very very weakly, he made for the woods, found shelter and covered himself with leaves.</p>

  <p><b>Book VI</b></p>

  <p>As Ulysses slept, covered in leaves, Minerva ran off to the city of the Phaeacians, taking the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's daughter (a friend of Nausicaa's). Minerva gave Nausicaa a dream that made her decide to wash her clothes in the morning. Nausicaa was soon to be married (the groom has not been decided yet) and she chose to wash up her and her family's clothes in preparation. She asked her father if she could take the mules, the clothes and the maids with her to wash down by the river, near to where Ulysses slept. Her father accepted her request.</p>
  <p>When she got down to the river, her and the maids woke up Ulysses. Ulysses kindly asked for help from the girls and indeed the girls aided weary Ulysses. They gave him food, drink, clothes and oils to wash himself with. Nausciaa and the other maids found Ulysses very attractive and thought that the gods might've sent him. Finally, Nausciaa brought Ulysses into the outskirts of the town into a rich garden where he could rest while Nausciaa went to talk to her father about Ulysses.</p>

  <p><b>Book VII</b></p>

  <p>Intead of waiting for Nausciaa to return, Ulysses got up and started walking through the town. Minerva took the form of a little girl and escorted him towards the house of Alcinous. Additionally, Minerva formed a cloud of dust around Ulysses so that none of the townspeople would notice him.</p>
  <p>When Ulysses arrived, King Alcinous welcomed him and fed him. Like his daughter, Alcinous also thought of Ulysses as someone sent from the heavens. Arete asked Ulysses how he came about his clothes, for they were clothes that Nausciaa gave him and Arete recognised the clothes. This question had Ulysses tell them his full story of how he came about the island of the Phaeacians. King Alcinous grew a liking to Ulysses and offered that he marry Nausciaa and have his own estate, but Alcinous also said he would not keep Ulysses on the island if he wishes to leave for home. After they conversed, Alcinous gave Ulysses a bed to sleep in for the night.</p>

  <p><b>Book VIII</b></p>

  <p>In the morning, Alcinous gathered all the people from the town together (with the help of Minerva in the form of one of Alcinous' servants) to help prepare Ulysses to leave town on a ship. They began performing a small ceremony for Ulysses, and then Alcinous started the games. He wanted to show Ulysses how good the Phaeacians were at wrestling, boxing, running, jumping, etc. Euryalus, one of the best Phaeacian wrestlers, criticized Ulysses of his athletic ability, essentially calling him weak. Ulysses grew very angry at Euryalus' remarks and threw a discus exceedingly farther than any of the other Phaeacians. The discus was heavier too. Alcinous apologized for Euryalus' rudeness. He then exclaimed that though their boxing and wrestling may not be that great, they, as a people, are excellent sailers, dancers, and singers. To prove this, Alcinous cleared the field and brought out 9 light-footed dancers to dance to music. Ulysses was impressed, and Alcinous was delighted.</p>
  <p>Alcinous came to really like Ulysses and demanded that his people (12 chief men) each give Ulysses a cloak, a shirt, and a talent of gold. In apology, Euryalus gave Ulysses a sword and they became friends. Additionally, Alcinous gave Ulysses a chest of goods. Finally, they gathered again to feast and Demodocus sang about the old battle between the Trojans and the Acheans. As Ulysses listened he began to cry. Alcinous noticed and stopped the singing. The book ends with Aclinous asking Ulysses more about where he came from and why the song would make him cry.</p>

  <p><b>Book IX</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses told Alcinous the beginning of his story before he became a slave to Calypso. After leaving Troy, Ulysses told Alcinous that he sailed to the city of Cicons where he sacked the town, killed some of the people and took their wives and booty. The Cicons, however, rallied and killed half of Ulysses' men. They sailed away and Jove conjured a storm, pushing them to the land of the inhuman Cyclopes.</p>
  <p>They explored the island and gathered up many sheep and goats, for the island had an abundance of them. Ulysses noticed smoke coming from another island (the island of the Cyclopes) not far from the harbor where their ships sailed in. Ulysses told the majority of his men to stay behind while he and 12 other men sailed to the island to explore. They came upon a cave and found milk, cheese, sheep and other valuables. Suddenly, in came the cyclopes Polyphemus.</p> 
  <p>Polyphemus did not welcome Ulysses and his men, in fact, Polyphemus ate a total of 6 of Ulysses men. Polyphemus additionally trapped the men inside his cave by rolling a large heavy rock in front of the doorway to block the entrance. In conversing with Polyphemus, Ulysses lied to him and told him that his name was Noman, which later helped Ulysses and the men escape.</p>
  <p>During the night, Ulysses and his men snuck up on Polyphemus while he was sleeping and gouged his eyes with sharp wooden objects that they fashioned. This bilnded Polyphemus and he called out for help from the other Cyclopes from inside the cave saying, "Noman is killing me by force!" The other Cyclopes replied, "if no man is attacking you, you must be ill" and they ignored his comments. Without the help of the other Cyclopes and with Polyphemus being blind, cunning Ulysses and his men were able to escape the cave by clinging onto the underbellies of the sheep when Polyphemus took them out to feed. When the men got back to the ships, Ulysses taunted Polyphemus shouting, "Cyclopes, if any one asks you who is was that put your eyes out and spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses." They then feasted and sailed away without any other casualties.</p>

  <p>After escaping Polyphemus, Ulysses explained to Alcinous that Ulysses and his men then arrived to the Aeolian island where he spoke with Aeolus and told him of his story after leaving Troy. Shortly after his visit he left and sailed for nine days and nine nights. When Ulysses met with Aeolus, Aeolus gave Ulysses a bag of winds that would help him travel back to his home. Ulysses' men were jealous because they thought the bag contained gold. When they went to open the bag, the winds escaped and pushed them all the way back to the Aeolian island. Ulysses asked for more help from Aeolus but none came and they were forced off the island.</p>
  <p>The men sailed again for just 6 days this time and arrived to Telepylus. When they explored the island further, the found that the king of this country was a giant named Antiphates. Antiphates, and the other ogres of the island started attaching Ulysses and his men and they were forced to sail away again.</p>
  <p>They arrived to the Aeaean island where the witch Circe lived. After Ulysses shot a stag and the men ate, they slept and in the morning, Eurylochus and a team of men explore the house of Circe. When they arrived, Circe gave the men posioned food and drink that turned them into pigs. Eurylochus managed to escape and told Ulysses. Then the god Mercury came down and gave Ulysses a herb that will protect him from Circe's spells. Ulysses left to save his men and the herb worked and he threatened Circe with his sword. Circe begged for forgiveness and Ulysses demanded that Circe turn Ulysses men back into humans. Circe agreed but only if Ulysses would sleep with her. Ulysses agreed but kept his gaurd.</p>
  <p>Finally, Ulysses men were turned back into men. They desired to leave, however, Circe claimed that if they were ever to get back to their homeland, they must first go to the house of Hades and consult Teiresias. Circe gave Ulysses further instructions on how to get to the house of Hades and what to do. Ulysses told his men and they groaned but knew that it had to be done if they were ever to get back to Ithaca.</p>

  <p><b>Book XI</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses continued explaining to Alcinous the adventure he took with his companions to summon spirits from the house of hades. The wind that Circe gave them guided them to the river Oceanus where they beached the ship and went ashore. Ulysses and the men performed the rituals which included cutting the throats of sheep and pouring their blood on the ground which would summon ghosts from the house of hades.</p>
  <p>The first ghost that was summoned was Elpenor (a companion of Ulysses who died when the men visited Circe) and he asked Ulysses to give him a proper burial. Ulysses then talks to his mother and it's a surprise to him to find out that she's dead. She claims to have died waiting for Ulysses return. Ulysses then grows tired and wishes to not tell Alcinous anymore of the story but Alcinous and Arete beg to hear more, so Ulysses continues. He talks more about the ghosts he saw that were warriors that fought in the Trojan war, including Achilles, Ajax, Patriclus, Agamemnon and others. Agamemnon tells the story of how he died, Achilles asks about his son, and Ajax doesn't speak a word to Ulysses because Ulysses won over his armour in a competition when Ajax was still alive. Suddenly more ghosts and phantoms arise out of the ground and it frightens Ulysses. He and his men ran back to the ship and sailed away.</p>

  <p><b>Book XII</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses continued telling his story to Alcinous and Arete. He explained how he arrived back to the Aeaean island and spoke more to Circe after seeing the ghosts. Circe gave Ulysses further instructions on where to sail. Ulysses and his men sailed away from the island yet again in hopes to finally arrive back to Ithaca.</p>
  <p>They sailed past Sirens which sang beautifully to Ulysses, trying to convince him to come ashore to their island. Circe warned Ulysses of the Sirens so Ulysses had his men tie him up to the ship so that he wouldn't be able to leave (apparently the other men weren't affected by the Sirens). After becoming clear of the Sirens, Ulysses and the men had to sail past the two monsters Scylla and Charybdis, both of which caused waves and whirlpools, trying to sink and destroy the ship. The men escaped the two monsters and arrived to the island of the sun-god where there were plently of cows and sheep to eat. Circe warned Ulysses that the men should not eat any of the livestock. Ulysses listened, but the men, starving to death, did not heed the instructions and partook in eating the cows from the island. The sun-god complained to Jove and when the men sailed away, Jove destroyed their ship with a bolt of lightning. It is unclear if any of the other men survived. Ulysses, however, floated adrift for 9 days until he finally came upon the Ogygian island where Calypso enslaved him. With this, he finished telling his story to Alcinous and Arete.</p>

  <p><b>Book XIII</b></p>

  <p>After Ulysses finished his story, Alcinous claimed that Ulysses should not overcome any more unpleasantries before he arrives to Ithaca. The next morning, Alcinous and some other Phaeacians gave Ulysses yet more treasures. Then Alcinous' men escorted Ulysses away an a ship with his goods and sailed towards Ithaca. Ulysses fell asleep on the ship and when they arrived to Ithaca, the men gently placed Ulysses (still asleep) and his goods on the shore of the Ithaca island and sailed back home.</p>
  <p>Neptune, angry at the Phaeacians for helping Ulysses, turned the ship to stone just as it reach the Phaeacian island. Alcinous knew that he and his people angered Neptune and prepared offerings of bull in hopes that Neptune would not bury the city under a high mountain (this was the prophecy Alcinous heard).</p>
  <p>When Ulysses woke up, he did not recognize the island and thought the Phaeacian men betrayed him. Minerva came to Ulysses as an old man and told Ulysses the truth; that he was on the island of Ithaca. Minerva then transformed into a woman and Ulysses discovered that he was in fact talking to the goddess Minerva. Minerva informed Ulysses of the suitors, and his estate, and his son. She then escorted him to a cave where they safely hid all his treasures and prepared to fight the suitors. Minerva disguised Ulysses by giving him wrinkles and getting rid of his hair so that Ulysses had the element of surprise.</p>

  <p><b>Book XIV</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses left the cave and journeyed into the woods until he reached his own property where he kept many pigs. The dogs barked furiously at him and an old man, Eumaeus, noticed Ulysses. Eumaeus welcomed him into his home and asked him who he was and how he came to this land. Ulysses told Eumaeus a lie (that he was the son of a Cretan). He further told Eumaeus that he was involved in the battle of Troy and fought alongside Menelaus and Ulysses. Ulysses also told Eumaeus a long, untrue story about how he came to Ithaca. Further, he told Eumaeus that Ulysses is sure to return very soon. Eumaeus believed all of what Ulysses told him except for the part about how Ulysses will soon return (he did not take lightly the false hope that 'this old man' was giving him), however Ulysses said Jove will make it so.</p>
  <p>After they conversed, Eumaeus gave Ulysses plently of pork and wine and Ulysses was happy to see that Eumaeus was taking good care of his estate. Finally, Ulysses and the other herdsmen slept, but before doing so, Ulysses told the men a story to convince Eumaeus to offer him a cloak because Ulysses was cold.</p>

  <p><b>Book XV</b></p>

  <p>Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon and told Ulysses' son that he should return to Ithaca immediately or else all the suitors would eat up his estate. Telemachus listened and went straight back to Ithaca with his companion Pisistratus and Menelaus' gifts.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile Ulysses told the swineherd that he wanted to venture into the town, visit Queen Penelope, and even meet the suitors, but the swineherd thought this idea to be very foolish. They told Ulysses to stay (recall that Ulysses is disguised as an old man), and wait for Telemachus to return to give him orders. Ulysses then asked about the state of his mother and father and Eumaeus told him that his father was living peacefully in his home and that his mother had died. Ulysses further asked about Eumaeus' father and mother and Eumaeus told him their story.</p>
  <p>When Telemachus returned to Ithaca, he told his men to take the ship on to the town while he went to visit the herdsman. He arrived to the fields where the swines were kept and that is the end of this book.</p>

  <p><b>Book XVI</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses and the swineherd heard footsteps coming and Telemachus approached. Since Ulysses was disguised as an old man by Minerva, Telemachus did not realize that it was his father sitting right in front of him. He accepted him as a servant nonetheless. Telemachus asked Eumaeus if his mother is still at home safe and without a suitor. Eumaeus confirmed this and Telemachus was relieved. Telemachus told Eumaeus to run to Penelope and tell her that he has returned to Ithaca.</p>
  <p>While Eumaeus was gone, and Ulysses (the disguised old man) and Telemachus were alone, Minerva transformed Ulysses back into himself. Telemachus was very suprised and thought Ulysses was a god at first and not his father. After all, even being transformed back into himmself, Telemachus still hadn't seen Ulysses in years. After further persuasion, Telemachus was convinced and embraced his father in a long hug. They conversed more about what to do about the 100+ suitors that were going to take over their estate. When Eumeaus returned, Minerva turned Ulysses back into an old man to make sure that Telemachus was the only one who knew who he truly was. They came up with a plan together and slept.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the suitors got word that Telemachus had returned. They agreed to kill Telemachus and claim all of his property, but only if they had the blessing of Jove. Eurymachus spoke this plan to Penelope, "but in reality he was plotting against Telemachus."</p>

  <p><b>Book XVII</b></p>

  <p>Telemachus woke and decided to visit his mother Penelope and let her know of his return himself. Theoclymenus, a seer, further told Penelope that he can sense that Ulysses was on the island. Telemachus then walked past the suitors, avoiding them and spoke with the old friends of his father's house: Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, who gave him gifts. The suitors stopped their sports and prepared dinner while Eumaeus brought Ulysses into the town to beg for food (Eumaeus still thought Ulysses was just a stranger and an old man).</p>
  <p>As Eumaeus and Ulysses walked past one of the suitors in the town (Melanthius), the suitor mocked the two of them and kicked Ulysses in the hip "out of pure wantonness", but Ulysses didn't budge. Ulysses thought about killing him right then and there but resisted the urge. Ulysses, Eumaeus, Telemachus, Penelope, and all the suitors eventually found themselves in Ulysses' house preparing for dinner. Just outside Ulysses' house, Ulysses noticed his dog Argos and asked Eumaeus how he was being treated. Argos was quite healthy, however he died "as soon as he had recognized his master".</p>
  <p>When the dinner began, the suitors began asking about the stranger (Ulysses). The suitors each gave Ulysses a gift, for is was customary and honorable to give to the poor, but Antinous did not agree and grew very angry with the stranger. Ulysses insulted him for not having the respect to offer him anything, and Antinous grew so angry that he threw a footstool at Ulysses, but Ulysses stood strong and it had no effect on him. The suitors turned on Antinous for disrespecting the old man, they thought it unwise since there is a small chance that the old man could be disguised as a god. Penelope pitied the stranger and asked Eumaeus to bring him closer to her so that they could talk more about where he came from. Ulysses insisted that they talk when the night began and when they could be alone, Penelope agreed to this. Finally, after the dinner, Eumaeus went back to his herd of pigs, and the suitors began singing and dancing.</p>

  <p><b>Book XVIII</b></p>

  <p>Just after the dinner there came a common tramp, a beggar named Arnaeus, however everyone called him Irus. Irus asked Ulysses to leave the house, claiming that everyone would rather have himself as the beggar of the house. Ulysses said that he didn't want any trouble, but if Irus were to fight him, then Ulysses would "cover his mouth and chest with blood". This angered Irus and he approached Ulysses ready to fight. Antinous noticed the fight begin and beckoned all the other suitors to watch. Antinous made a game out of it and said the winner would get a prize and the loser would have to leave the house. Ulysses won the fight easily, dragged Irus outside by the foot and propped him up against a wall. Ulysses returned to the house and got his reward.</p>
  <p>After the fight, Penelope came down to the dining room and some of the suitors proceeded to woo her by complimenting her beauty. To all of them she responded that her beauty had left her when Ulysses left to Troy, but that Ulysses would soon return and she'd regain her beauty. Penelope also said things to try to get presents out of the suitors, even though she didn't mean a thing she said. Antinous replied by saying that all of the suitors would not leave the house until she made a decision on who to marry. With this Penelope went back to her room and Ulysses told the maids to go comfort her, but the maids only laughed at Ulysses because he was still disguised as a beggar. Ulysses threatened to tell Telemachus that they were mocking him and that Telemachus would tear them limb from limb if they did not do as Ulysses commanded. Out of fear they went up to Penelope's room.</p>
  <p>After this Eurymachus mocked Ulysses for being a beggar, but Ulysses retaliated by calling him insolent and cruel. Eurymachus tried throwing a footstool at Ulysses but missed and hit the cupbearer. This caused an uproar and all the suitors decided it was time to banish Ulysses from the house. Telemachus told them all to calm down and that Ulysses would stay in the house as long as he allowed. To this they all drank and made their drink-offerings to the blessed gods.</p>

  <p><b>Book XIX</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses pondered by the cloister where he thought about how to kill all the suitors. He met with Telemachus and told him to gather all the weapons and armor and set them inside the house, and if the suitors asked what he was doing, he'd say the weapons needed cleaning. After Telemachus and Ulysses took the weapons inside, Ulysses finally had the chance to speak with Penelope alone.</p>
  <p>Ulysses told Penelope the false story of where he came from, and that he fought alongside Ulysses at a time during his adventure. Penelope believe all that she was told, but only after Ulysses told her the exact armor that he said he saw Ulysses wear (again, Ulysses is still disguised as an old beggar). Penelope began to cry as "the old beggar" told her about Ulysses and Ulysses fought back his tears. After conversing, Penelope told the eldest maid Euryclea told wash Ulysses' feet and clean him up. Euryclea helped raise Ulysses when he was just a child. As she washed him, she noticed a scar on his leg that looked exactly like the scar that Ulysses had, which he got from hunting a boar as a younger boy. Euryclea couldn't keep herself together when she saw this and nearly called out to Penelope to tell her that this old man is Ulysses, but Ulysses caught her by the throat and told her not to speak another word. He explained to her that it is crucial that nobody knows that he's actually Ulysses until he gets rid of all the suitors.</p>
  <p>After getting his feet washed, Penelope told Ulysses of a dream which she thought as a sign that Ulysses might return. Ulysses comforted her and told her that it's bound to happen and that all the suitors shall die. With this she went back up to her room and slept.</p>

  <p><b>Book XX</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses woke with anger in his heart, feeling ready to fight and kill all the suitors and take back his estate, but he feared he would not be able to do so. Minerva comforted him and told him that all things will be possible as long as he has the gods on his side. Penelope also had her doubts, however a maid came to her aid when she was feeling suicidal.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile all the other suitors are planning to kill Telemachus, but they decide to withhold their evil plans when they see an eagle fly above with a dove in its talons. Even though the suitors withheld theirs plans, Minerva encouraged them to be ever more foul so as to keep Ulysses furious at them. One of the suitors then throws a hoof at Ulysses while they were all feasting on more meats. Ulysses dodges the hoof and Telemachus threatens to kill the suitor if he didn't treat the "old stranger" with respect. At this all the suitors start laughing uncontrollably. Telemachus took no action, but expected his father at any moment to start his attack on the suitors.</p>

  <p><b>Book XXI</b></p>

  <p>Minerva placed an idea in Penelope's mind to make the suitors try their skill with the bow and iron axes in hopes to bring controversy between themselves. She gathered up Ulysses' old bow and all of Ulysses' iron and bronze. She brought these things to the suitors and told them that if any of them could string Ulysses' bow, she would leave the house and be the wife of whomever could do so. Telemachus heard Penelope's proposition as well and agreed, however he wished to give it a try as well. </p>
  <p>Telemachus tried three times to string the bow. On his fourth try, he would have succeeded but Ulysses gave him a sign (perhaps a wink) to tell him to stop trying. Telemachus thus faked his fourth try and claimed that he could not string the bow. A man named Leiodes tried and failed and said that nobody will be able to string it. Antinous grew angry at his words and competitive, he beckoned others to try to string the bow. Eurymachus tried to string the bow but couldn't and accepted that there are other fine women in Ithaca for him. The suitors took a break and drank before trying to string the bow again. They also made sure that nobody else attempted to string the bow during their break.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Ulysses revealed himself to a Stockman and Eumaeus. They both shed tears of happiness, but Ulysses to them to hold their tears back to not break his cover. Then Ulysses said he'd like to give stringing the bow a try but the suitors mocked him, they thought only the suitors (and Telemachus) should be given the chance to string the bow. They also feared that Ulysses would actually be able to string the bow and take Penelope away. After Penelope intervened and they all conversed, Ulysses had his chance. He strung the bow easily, loaded an arrow, and let it fly through each one of the handle-holes of the axes that were set up and into the courtyard. Afterwards he told Telemachus that it's time to have dinner, singing and dancing with the Achaeans while there is still daylight.</p>

  <p><b>Book XXII</b></p>

  <p>When Ulysses won the contest, he suddenly loaded another arrow and shot Antinous in the throat. The suitors, very surprised, went to grab their weapons, but earlier Telemachus had removed them. The suitors thought that "the old man" had shot Antinous by mistake, but when Ulysses finally revealed himself, they all grew very frightened of him. Eurymachus first begged for forgiveness and said he would repay Ulysses all that he was due, but Ulysses refused the offer. Eurymachus knew he had no choice but to fight, he drew a blade and charged Ulysses but Ulysses shot Eurymachus in the breast and killed him too.</p>
  <p>Ulysses told his son Telemachus to run to the store room and grab sheilds and other weapons to fight off the suitors while Ulysses held them off. The swineherd saw a suitor Melanthius running to the store room to grab weapons and asked Ulysses what to do. Ulysses told him to bind Melanthius' hands and feet while Telemachus and he fought off the rest of the suitors. Eumaeus (the swineherd) did exactly what Ulysses said, locked the store room, and joined the battle along Ulysses' side.</p>
  <p>They all fought and some of the suitors begged for mercy, such as Leiodes, but Ulysses showed no mercy and killed him. However, when Medon begged for mercy, Ulysses spared him. After the battle was won by Ulysses, he spoke to the nurse Euryclea and asked her which of the other women (maids and nurses) of the house had misconducted themselves while Ulysses was away. Euryclea claimed there were twelve such women. Ulysses made them clean up the dead suitors in the house and then had Telemachus hang them. Additionally, Ulysses and Telemachus took Melanthius to the inner court where they cut off his nose, ears, and split him open for the dogs to eat his guts raw. To top this off, they cut off his hands and feet in fury. Thus, the battle against the suitors was won.</p>

  <p><b>Book XXIII</b></p>

  <p>Euryclea went upstairs to tell Penelope that great news that Ulysses had returned and killed all the suitors. Penelope did not believe her at first and asked Euryclea to stop mocking her. After some persuasion, Penelope came down from her room to see Ulysses. Still with some doubt, Penelope did not sit next to Ulysses and ask him questions about his journey. Ulysses was not offended, for it has been long since Penelope has seen him and he was covered in dirt and rags. Ulysses told everyone it's time to celebrate and clean up, then maybe Penelope will believe that he is Ulysses himself.</p>
  <p>The townspeople saw the celebrations taking place and thought that one of the suitors must be marrying Penelope, for they did not know of the suitors' death or the return of Ulysses. After Ulysses talked to Penelope more, Penelope came to realize that Ulysses was truly himself after talking about their bed because only Uylsses, a maid, and herself knew of it's contents. Finally, Ulysses regained the full love of Penelope. Ulysses then told Penlope of his adventures.</p>
  <p>After conversing, Ulysses told Penelope to stay up in her room while he, Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus armed themselves and ran out of the town to visit Ulysses' father</p>
