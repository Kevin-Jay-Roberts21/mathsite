    <p><b>BOOK I</b></p>
    
    <p>Our story begins concerning Ulysses. After the battle of Troy, all the other soliders made it safely home except for Ulysses who was detained by the goddess Calypso (who wants to marry him) on an island in the middle of the sea. All the gods pittied him, except for Neptune (because Ulysses had blinded the eye of Neptune's son: Polyphemus, king of the Cyclopes), and decided that it's time he escape the island and return home to his wife and son.</p>
    <p>In their decision, Minerva went down from Olympus in the form of Mentes, chief of the Taphians and an old friend of Ulysses and visited Telemachus. Additionally, Minerva told Mercury to tell Calypso that the gods have made up their mind, that Ulysses should return home.</p>
    <p>During Minerva's visit, they spoke amoungst many other men who ate freely at Telemachus' house, for they were suitors to Telemachus' mother. Telemachus was worried that without Ulysses, the suitors will make havoc of his estate and then with himself. Thus, Minerva convinced Telemachus to summon at least 20 men to leave in the morning to search for his father. Telemachus had the feeling all along that he was speaking to a goddess and not Mentes himself.</p>

    <p><b>Book II</b></p>

    <p>Telemachus woke the next morning and spoke to the people saying that he was most aggreived by the absence of his father. Telemachus also exclaimed his frustration at the suitors for eating all his food, drinking his wine, and making themselves at home in his own estate. The suitors (specifically Antinous) said that it's Telemachus' mother to blame because Antinous claims she said that she thinks Ulysses is dead and that she will consider a suitor after she finishes making a pall for the hero Laertes. It's been 3 years since she started (almost 4 now) and she's not done yet. This is because during the night she undoes her work and starts again in the morning.</p>
    <p>Antinous and Telemachus argued the matter and suddenly two eagles flew down from the heavens (sent by Jove) who fought each other fiercely. Halitherses took it as an omen that Ulysses should soon return, but Eurymachus said it was all rubbish and told the old man to go home. Telemachus made a deal with the suitors, that they should give him 20 men and he'd sial away in search of his father. If he finds that his father is dead, then he'd allow a suitor to marry his mother, otherwise, the suitors are to leave his estate alone.</p>
    <p>Telemachus then prayed to Minerva for help and Minerva answered. She provided him a ship with 20 volunteers from the village. Telemachus then spoke to the nurse Euryclea about his leaving. None of the other maids, or even Telemachus' mother, knew of his leaving. Finally, Telemachus set sail with the men in search for his father.</p>

    <p><b>Book III</b></p>

    <p>Telemachus, Minerva, and the rest of the men arrived to Pylos, city of Neleus. Nestor greeted them and Minerva encouraged Telemachus to speak directly to wise Nestor and ask him where he might find his father. Nestor gave them food and drink and told Telemachus the story of when he last saw Ulysses.</p>
    <p>Nestor explained to Telemachus that when the Achaeans were at war with the Trojans, some of the men decided to leave Troy and sail home. Agamemenon, the King of the Achaean army, did not approve of this and wanted all the men to stay. As some of the men were sailing home, some turned back (including Ulysses), to make their "peace" with Agamemnon. Nestor did not turn back and therefore did not have any fortunate information about Telemachus' father Ulysses. Additionally, Nester and Ulysses talked more of the death of Agamemnon (killed by Aegisthus).</p>
    <p>Nestor gave Telemachus further advice to not stay away from home for too long because the suitors may take everything from him. Nestor also told Telemachus to speak with Menelaus, for Menelaus just got back from a long voyage and might have information about Ulysses. Nestor gave Telemachus horse transportation, provided by Nestor's sons and they rode out to visit Menelaus.</p>
  </p>

  <p><b>Book IV</b></p>

  <p>Pisistratus and Telemachus arrived at Lacedaemon and drove straight to the house of Menelaus. At the time, Menelaus was celebrating the wedding of his son and his daughter. Even with the disruption of Telemachus' arrival, kind Menelaus still welcomed them in and gave them food and drink. Before Telemachus could say anything about who he was or why he came, Menelaus spoke of how he missed Ulysses, and it brought tears to Telemachus' eyes. After this Menelaus soon found out who Telemachus was. They all wept when they spoke more of Ulysses.</p>
  <p>Helen, wife to Menelaus, put a drug in the wine which restricts the shedding of tears to all who partake of it. They reminisced more about Ulysses until they finally went to bed. In the morning, Telemachus finally told Menelaus the reason of his visit; to find his father. Menelaus then told Telemachus a story of when the gods detained him in Egypt. Idothea, a sea-goddess, told Menelaus to speak with Proteus to ask for help in escaping the island (Pharos). Menelaus did so and further asked Proteus about where his other comrades were (the warriors who fought in the Trojan war). Proteus told Menelaus that many had died and further told him that Ulysses was trapped by Calypso on an island. When Telemachus heard of this from Menelaus, he made further plans to save his father.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, back in Ithaca, Antinous and Eurymachus found out that Telemachus had left in search of his father and grew very angry. They, by no means, would let Telemachus return. They armored themselves, along with 20 other men, and sailed to Asteris (an island between Ithaca and Samos), and placed themselves ready to ambush Telemachus should he return. Penelope also found out about Telemachus' and wept. Minerva sent a vision to Penelope to comfort her, saying that her son has the gods on his side and will return to Ithaca.</p>

  <p><b>Book V</b></p>

  <p>The gods discussed the state of Ulysses and Minerva, more than anyone else, said he should be set free from Calypso. Jove told Mercury to send a message to Calypso; that the gods have decided Ulysses should return home. Mercury let Calypso know and Calypso grew very angry. With more persuasion, however, Calypso accepted.</p>
  <p>Calypso went to Ulysses by the sea shore and told him that she was going to set him free. Ulysses thought there was some trickery behind her plan but she was sincere. She gave him an axe to cut wood and craft a raft. Finally, Ulysses said that he would not leave unless he knew Neptune would not destory his raft in the rough sea. Calypso said he would be safe, but it was not so. When Ulysses set off, Neptune found out and destroyed his raft in anger. Ulysses was forced to swim. Ino, a sea-goddess, pitied Ulysses and gave him her enchanted veil which allowed him to "come to no harm" as long as he wears it. With this Ulysses continued swimming (for 2 days) until he finally reached the land of the Phaeacians. He threw the veil back into the water to return it to Ino. Very very weakly, he made for the woods, found shelter and covered himself with leaves.</p>

  <p><b>Book VI</b></p>

  <p>As Ulysses slept, covered in leaves, Minerva ran off to the city of the Phaeacians, taking the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's daughter (a friend of Nausicaa's). Minerva gave Nausicaa a dream that made her decide to wash her clothes in the morning. Nausicaa was soon to be married (the groom has not been decided yet) and she chose to wash up her and her family's clothes in preparation. She asked her father if she could take the mules, the clothes and the maids with her to wash down by the river, near to where Ulysses slept. Her father accepted her request.</p>
  <p>When she got down to the river, her and the maids woke up Ulysses. Ulysses kindly asked for help from the girls and indeed the girls aided weary Ulysses. They gave him food, drink, clothes and oils to wash himself with. Nausciaa and the other maids found Ulysses very attractive and thought that the gods might've sent him. Finally, Nausciaa brought Ulysses into the outskirts of the town into a rich garden where he could rest while Nausciaa went to talk to her father about Ulysses.</p>

  <p><b>Book VII</b></p>

  <p>Intead of waiting for Nausciaa to return, Ulysses got up and started walking through the town. Minerva took the form of a little girl and escorted him towards the house of Alcinous. Additionally, Minerva formed a cloud of dust around Ulysses so that none of the townspeople would notice him.</p>
  <p>When Ulysses arrived, King Alcinous welcomed him and fed him. Like his daughter, Alcinous also thought of Ulysses as someone sent from the heavens. Arete asked Ulysses how he came about his clothes, for they were clothes that Nausciaa gave him and Arete recognised the clothes. This question had Ulysses tell them his full story of how he came about the island of the Phaeacians. King Alcinous grew a liking to Ulysses and offered that he marry Nausciaa and have his own estate, but Alcinous also said he would not keep Ulysses on the island if he wishes to leave for home. After they conversed, Alcinous gave Ulysses a bed to sleep in for the night.</p>

  <p><b>Book VIII</b></p>

  <p>In the morning, Alcinous gathered all the people from the town together (with the help of Minerva in the form of one of Alcinous' servants) to help prepare Ulysses to leave town on a ship. They began performing a small ceremony for Ulysses, and then Alcinous started the games. He wanted to show Ulysses how good the Phaeacians were at wrestling, boxing, running, jumping, etc. Euryalus, one of the best Phaeacian wrestlers, criticized Ulysses of his athletic ability, essentially calling him weak. Ulysses grew very angry at Euryalus' remarks and threw a discus exceedingly farther than any of the other Phaeacians. The discus was heavier too. Alcinous apologized for Euryalus' rudeness. He then exclaimed that though their boxing and wrestling may not be that great, they, as a people, are excellent sailers, dancers, and singers. To prove this, Alcinous cleared the field and brought out 9 light-footed dancers to dance to music. Ulysses was impressed, and Alcinous was delighted.</p>
  <p>Alcinous came to really like Ulysses and demanded that his people (12 chief men) each give Ulysses a cloak, a shirt, and a talent of gold. In apology, Euryalus gave Ulysses a sword and they became friends. Additionally, Alcinous gave Ulysses a chest of goods. Finally, they gathered again to feast and Demodocus sang about the old battle between the Trojans and the Acheans. As Ulysses listened he began to cry. Alcinous noticed and stopped the singing. The book ends with Aclinous asking Ulysses more about where he came from and why the song would make him cry.</p>

  <p><b>Book IX</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses told Alcinous the beginning of his story before he became a slave to Calypso. After leaving Troy, Ulysses told Alcinous that he sailed to the city of Cicons where he sacked the town, killed some of the people and took their wives and booty. The Cicons, however, rallied and killed half of Ulysses' men. They sailed away and Jove conjured a storm, pushing them to the land of the inhuman Cyclopes.</p>
  <p>They explored the island and gathered up many sheep and goats, for the island had an abundance of them. Ulysses noticed smoke coming from another island (the island of the Cyclopes) not far from the harbor where their ships sailed in. Ulysses told the majority of his men to stay behind while he and 12 other men sailed to the island to explore. They came upon a cave and found milk, cheese, sheep and other valuables. Suddenly, in came the cyclopes Polyphemus.</p> 
  <p>Polyphemus did not welcome Ulysses and his men, in fact, Polyphemus ate a total of 6 of Ulysses men. Polyphemus additionally trapped the men inside his cave by rolling a large heavy rock in front of the doorway to block the entrance. In conversing with Polyphemus, Ulysses lied to him and told him that his name was Noman, which later helped Ulysses and the men escape.</p>
  <p>During the night, Ulysses and his men snuck up on Polyphemus while he was sleeping and gouged his eyes with sharp wooden objects that they fashioned. This bilnded Polyphemus and he called out for help from the other Cyclopes from inside the cave saying, "Noman is killing me by force!" The other Cyclopes replied, "if no man is attacking you, you must be ill" and they ignored his comments. Without the help of the other Cyclopes and with Polyphemus being blind, cunning Ulysses and his men were able to escape the cave by clinging onto the underbellies of the sheep when Polyphemus took them out to feed. When the men got back to the ships, Ulysses taunted Polyphemus shouting, "Cyclopes, if any one asks you who is was that put your eyes out and spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses." They then feasted and sailed away without any other casualties.</p>

  <p><b>Book X</b></p>

  <p>After escaping Polyphemus, Ulysses explained to Alcinous that Ulysses and his men then arrived to the Aeolian island where he spoke with Aeolus and told him of his story after leaving Troy. Shortly after his visit he left and sailed for nine days and nine nights. When Ulysses met with Aeolus, Aeolus gave Ulysses a bag of winds that would help him travel back to his home. Ulysses' men were jealous because they thought the bag contained gold. When they went to open the bag, the winds escaped and pushed them all the way back to the Aeolian island. Ulysses asked for more help from Aeolus but none came and they were forced off the island.</p>
  <p>The men sailed again for just 6 days this time and arrived to Telepylus. When they explored the island further, the found that the king of this country was a giant named Antiphates. Antiphates, and the other ogres of the island started attaching Ulysses and his men and they were forced to sail away again.</p>
  <p>They arrived to the Aeaean island where the witch Circe lived. After Ulysses shot a stag and the men ate, they slept and in the morning, Eurylochus and a team of men explore the house of Circe. When they arrived, Circe gave the men posioned food and drink that turned them into pigs. Eurylochus managed to escape and told Ulysses. Then the god Mercury came down and gave Ulysses a herb that will protect him from Circe's spells. Ulysses left to save his men and the herb worked and he threatened Circe with his sword. Circe begged for forgiveness and Ulysses demanded that Circe turn Ulysses men back into humans. Circe agreed but only if Ulysses would sleep with her. Ulysses agreed but kept his gaurd.</p>
  <p>Finally, Ulysses men were turned back into men. They desired to leave, however, Circe claimed that if they were ever to get back to their homeland, they must first go to the house of Hades and consult Teiresias. Circe gave Ulysses further instructions on how to get to the house of Hades and what to do. Ulysses told his men and they groaned but knew that it had to be done if they were ever to get back to Ithaca.</p>

  <p><b>Book XI</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses continued explaining to Alcinous the adventure he took with his companions to summon spirits from the house of hades. The wind that Circe gave them guided them to the river Oceanus where they beached the ship and went ashore. Ulysses and the men performed the rituals which included cutting the throats of sheep and pouring their blood on the ground which would summon ghosts from the house of hades.</p>
  <p>The first ghost that was summoned was Elpenor (a companion of Ulysses who died when the men visited Circe) and he asked Ulysses to give him a proper burial. Ulysses then talks to his mother and it's a surprise to him to find out that she's dead. She claims to have died waiting for Ulysses return. Ulysses then grows tired and wishes to not tell Alcinous anymore of the story but Alcinous and Arete beg to hear more, so Ulysses continues. He talks more about the ghosts he saw that were warriors that fought in the Trojan war, including Achilles, Ajax, Patriclus, Agamemnon and others. Agamemnon tells the story of how he died, Achilles asks about his son, and Ajax doesn't speak a word to Ulysses because Ulysses won over his armour in a competition when Ajax was still alive. Suddenly more ghosts and phantoms arise out of the ground and it frightens Ulysses. He and his men ran back to the ship and sailed away.</p>

  <p><b>Book XII</b></p>

  <p>Ulysses continued telling his story to Alcinous and Arete. He explained how he arrived back to the Aeaean island and spoke more to Circe after seeing the ghosts. Circe gave Ulysses further instructions on where to sail. Ulysses and his men sailed away from the island yet again in hopes to finally arrive back to Ithaca.</p>
  <p>They sailed past Sirens which sang beautifully to Ulysses, trying to convince him to come ashore to their island. Circe warned Ulysses of the Sirens so Ulysses had his men tie him up to the ship so that he wouldn't be able to leave (apparently the other men weren't affected by the Sirens). After becoming clear of the Sirens, Ulysses and the men had to sail past the two monsters Scylla and Charybdis, both of which caused waves and whirlpools, trying to sink and destroy the ship. The men escaped the two monsters and arrived to the island of the sun-god where there were plently of cows and sheep to eat. Circe warned Ulysses that the men should not eat any of the livestock. Ulysses listened, but the men, starving to death, did not heed the instructions and partook in eating the cows from the island. The sun-god complained to Jove and when the men sailed away, Jove destroyed their ship with a bolt of lightning. It is unclear if any of the other men survived. Ulysses, however, floated adrift for 9 days until he finally came upon the Ogygian island where Calypso enslaved him. With this, he finished telling his story to Alcinous and Arete.</p>
