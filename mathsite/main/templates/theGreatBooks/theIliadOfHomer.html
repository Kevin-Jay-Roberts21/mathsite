    <p><b>BOOK I</b></p>
    
    <p>This story begins by saying there was some great peril that was brought upon the Achaeans. Sending many of them down to Hades due to a consistent plague. The son of Jove, and Leto were the culprits of this. They were mad because the kings of the Achaeans had dishonoured Chryses.</p>
    <p>The Achaeans had kidnapped Chryses' daughter, so Chryses traveled to the Achaeans to get her back. By doing so he offered the chiefs of the Achaeans a ransom; specifically "the sceptre Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant's wreath".</p>
    <p>Agamemnon heard Chryses' plea to get his daughter back but Agamemnon would not accept his ransom. He told Chryses to leave and never come back, contrary to the rest of the Achaeans who wanted to accept the ransom.</p>
    <p>Chryses then prayed to the god Apollo, asking him to "avenge his tears", which I believe meant he wished to have the Achaeans killed, or at least Agamemnon. Apollo answered his prayer, came down from Olympus, and shot the Achaeans' livestock for 9 days. Finally, Achilles, in his confusion, approached Calchas and asked him if he know why the livestock were being killed and why they obtained a plague. Thereon, a seer told Achilles that it was because of the God Apollo and that the only way to stop the plague and the killings was to give Chryses his daughter back. Agamemnon heard this and was furious.</p>
    <p>Agamemnon went on to say that he loved the girl more than his wife, but that he would give her away if it saves his people from the plague. However, he said he'd still require a "prize". Achilles said he doesn't need one and there's nothing to give him. Agamemnon agreed to sail away to return Chryses' daughter, but still demanded a prize, this time from Achilles and Achilles now grew angry with Agamemnon for Agamemnon expressed hurtful words towards Achilles.</p>
    <p>Now Achilles was furous with Agememnon, he nearly drew his sword in anger when Minerva, goddess of wisdom, came down from the heavens and stopped him. Instead, Achilles simply proceeded to insult Agamemnon back, essentially calling him a coward.</p>
    <p>Hector intervened, said Agamemnon should not take the girl away because Achilles will one day become king and replace Agamemnon. Agamemnon agreed that Achilles is a great warrior, but a foolish one. They eventually came to an accord and the Achaeans took Chryses' daughter, Chryseis, on a ship to deliever her back to the Chryses.</p>
    <p>Now remember how Agamemnon said he would not give away Chryseis without a prize in return? After not recieving anything, he sent his servants to steal Bresies, a woman living with Achilles, his "true love". Achilles was aware of the theives and let them take Brieis to Agamemnon, but told the gaurds that Agamemnon will regret stealing from "the great Achilles".</p>
    <p>Achilles wept to his mother and told her everything that happened. He asked for her to beckon Zeus for help and so she said she'd visit Olympus and ask him to aid Achilles in his time of sorrow.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the Achaeans arrived to Chryses, lead by Ulysses. They delivered Chryseis, feasted happily, then sailed back to their home. The god Apollo had thus forgiven the Achaeans.</p>
    <p>Thetis ended up making it to Olympus, pressed Zeus to do something about Achilles losing Briseis, and Zeus never made a decision. He pondered about it, suggested that he could force the Trojans to attack the Achaeans, but Zeus's wife Juno did not like that idea since she was fond of the Achaeans. The fought the idea for a while, their son The Vulcan calmed them down, they then drank sweet nectar and all went to bed, with Zeus still needing to make a decision about what to do for Achilles.</p>
  
    <p><b>NOTE: </b>Now that I've got a good grasp on the characters, I'll proceed to read each book without taking notes as I go. Instead I'll finish each book with a summary of events.</p>

    <p><b>BOOK II</b></p>

    <p>Zeus thought of how to do honour to Achilles. His conclusion was to give him the kingdom of Troy, but it must be taken over. Thus, he sent a dream to Agamemnon, (King of the Achaeans), which was delivered by Nestor while Agamemnon was sleeping. Agamemnon woke and spoke to his soldiers. He told them to bare arms for they were going to go conquer Troy.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the goddess Juno, told the goddess Minerva to deliver a message to Ulysses, a message saying they should not fight Troy, for there have been to many Achaean lives lost in the battling Troy in the past. Ulysses went to the kings and captains of the Achaean army and told them to not be so eager in battling Troy, for they don't know the full intent of Agamemnon yet.</p>
    <p>Thersites beckoned Agamemnon to not battle Troy. Ulysses called him a coward and beat him. Thersites had changed Ulysses mind about battling Troy. The Achaean people gathered many soldiers and ships and prepared for war. Word got out to the Trojans, and they too gathered all their forces to defend their kingdom.</p>

    <p><b>Book III</b></p>
    
    <p>The battle between the Achaeans and the Trojans was about to begin. Hector, King of the Trojans, spoke with his brother Alexander (Paris) with an idea. As the battle was about to begin, Hector saw Menelaus approach Alexander in pursuit to kill him. Hector saw Alexander cower. So, Hector's idea was to have Alexander and Menelaus conduct a solo battle to the death. The winner would gain fortunes from the other, along with Helen and her belongings.</p>
    <p>The propsition was said to Agamemnon and the Achaeans agreed. Everyone gathered around to witness the duel, including Helen and Alexander's father Priam. Priam decided he couldn't watch the fight because he knew the outcome would result in the death of his son. He fled to Ilius.</p>
    <p>The battle began. Paris was losing and all the while Menelaus was praying to Jove as he faught. The goddess Venus, a goddess and daughter of Jove, heard of the battle, flew down from Olympus, and snatched up Paris "(as a god can do)" and brought him to his own bedchamber. The battlefield was left with smoke, thus nobody knew what happened to Paris. They all assumed he had parished or fled, and so Menelaus was deemed the victor. Venus, also took Helen to the bedchamber to join Paris. Helen thought Paris was a coward but she stayed with him all the same.</p>
    <p>The Achaeans thought Menelaus had won and demanded Helen and all her wealth.</p>

    <p><b>Book IV</b></p>

    <p>Before any fighting had begun, the goddess Minerva came down from the heavens (by order of "the sire of the gods", I'm assuming Zeus) in the form of Laodocus, and told a Trojan warrior, Pandarus, to fire an arrow at Menelaus. Minerva told Pandarus he'd be doing honour to Paris. Foolish Pandarus did so, and shot down Menelaus, he was not killed but only wounded near his belt.</p>
    <p>Menelaus' brother Agamemnon quickly came to his aid and was furious. He got Menelaus a surgeon and then told all of the Archaean soldiers to attack the Trojans and the battle began. Agamemnon went to each of his captains and urged them to fight. He noticed Ulysses standing still with his men, unaware of the battle beginning. Agamemnon called him a coward for not fighting, but Ulysses claimed he didn't know the fighting started. So, in rage, he and his men charged the Trojans to do honour to Agamemnon. Achilles, did not join the battle, but remaining by the ships, nursing his anger.</p>
    <p>Many bodies of Trojans and Achaeans lay dead as the battle pressed on.</p>

    <p><b>Book V</b></p>

    <p>Diomed, an excellent Greek warrior and commander, flung himself into battle and killed many of the Trojans. He was shot in the shoulder by an arrow during the fight which made him rage even more and kill more Trojan knights. Many other warriors fought and killed eachother during Diomed's rage. When it seemed like the Tojans were winning, the Achaeans rallied back and vice versa. Minerva, Juno, and Mars aided in the battle (Minerva and Juno for the Achaeans, Mars for the Trojans). When Diomed found out that he was battling the god Mars, he grew scared, but Minerva told him to keep fighting. Diomed wounded the god Mars and sent him back up to Olympus. Mars complained to Zeus, but Zeus did nothing and told Mars that he pittied him and disiliked him. Once Mars left the battle the goddesses Minerva and Juno also joined up back in the house of Jove.</p>

    <p><b>Book VI</b></p>

    <p>The Achaeans are winning. Diomed, Agamemnon, and Menelaus are killing Trojan warriors one at a time. Nestor rallied the Achaeans as well, telling them to leave no Trojan alive and to take all the spoils. </p>
    <p>Diomed and Glaucus (a warrior for the Trojans) met on the battlefield. Diomed spoke first and told him to prepare to meet his doom if, that is, he his mortal. Diomed dare not fight a god. Glaucus got to talking about his lineage, and Diomed found out that Glaucus is an old friend of Diomed's fathers' house. In simpler terms, Diomed's and Glaucus' ancestors were allies of of the same lineage. They agreed not to fight each other if their spears ever crossed again.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Hector retreated into the city of Priam. He asked his mother to get the matrons together and leave to the temple of the goddess Minerva to offer her gifts in hopes that she'd stop the Achaeans from killing the Trojans. Minerva declined the offer. In a panic, Hector ran to his brother (Prias) and told him to get ready to fight. Then Hector ran to the high walls of Ilius to find his wife and child. He bid them one last goodbye as they left to the safety of the inner city. Hector and Prias (brothers), then waited by the high walls of Ilius for the Achaeans to arrive.</p>

    <p><b>Book VII</b></p>

    <p>The sons of Priam (Prias and Hector) left the inner walls of Ilius and went into battle with the Achaeans. The two great champions killed yet more Achaeans. Minerva saw this happening and left Olympus to aid the Achaeans. Apollo saw her leave and proposed that instead of aiding the Achaeans, have Hector battle in single combat with an Achaean champion. Minerva agreed and got the message to Hector.</p>
    <p>Hector had the Achaeans and Trojans all take a seat and proposed the idea. The Achaeans agreed. Menelaus jumped to the idea of battling Hector, but Menelaus' brother Agamemnon told Menelaus that Hector is a better warrior than him. Nestor, had an idea of who to pick to fight Hector. Instead of the Achaeans agreeing on a single man to fight Hector, nine champions jumped to their feet, great enough to battle Hector, and they picked one of the nine by randomly selecting a name out of a helmet. Ajax was the champion chosen.</p>
    <p>Ajax and Hector fought one on one and neither was able to kill the other. The fight went on until night fell upon the land. Hector suggested that they stop fighting and have a truce and resume until day began. The Achaeans agreed and left to their ships where they built a sturdy wall and trench around them. The Trojans also left to the safety of their city. </p>
    <p>Priam, the king of the Trojans, sent a messanger to the Achaeans at daybreak, Idaeus, to tell the Achaeans that the Trojans will give them offerings, not including beautiful Helen, to keep the truce. The Achaeans refused and said they're going to take everything. The next day the Achaeans and Trojans burned their dead and then slept soundlessly.</p>

    <p><b>Book VIII</b></p>

    <p>Jove was furious with his fellow gods for taking part in the battle of the Achaeans and the Trojans. He told the other gods that there'd be great consequences for anyone who interacted in the battle again. After the Trojans and Achaeans ate their breakfast, they engaged in battle.</p>
    <p>For reasons I'm unsure, Zeus decided to strike the Achaeans with his lightning. The Achaeans fled in fear back to their ships, for none of them thought it wise to fight against Jove. Juno spoke to Agamemnon and gave him courage. She told him that he and his people should not be afraid, for she is watching over them. This gave the Achaeans courage. They rallied back and a great archer Teucer, shot and killed many Trojans. The only Trojan he could not kill was Hector. Apollo was watching over him.</p>
    <p>Hector raged and killed many more Achaeans. The Achaeans were falling back and losing the battle. Minvera and Juno tried to join the battle, but Jove found out, threatened them greatly, and they decided not to engage in the battle. Finally, the day came to an end and all the warriors rested themselves and their horses for the night. This time the Achaeans stayed behind their trench and walls near their ships and the Trojans made camp just outside the Achaeans base.</p>

    <p><b>Book IX</b></p>

    <p>King Agamemnon was not feeling good about fighting the Trojans. He feared that all the Achaeans would perish, so he spoke to his men and told them to gather in their ships and sail home. Diomed spoke before anyone took Agamemnon's orders and convinced them all to stay and fight. Agamemnon agreed and gained courage, however he thought it was clear that Jove was on the Trojans side of the battle. Nestor advised Agamemnon to provided Achilles with many offerings, including Briseis, in hopes that these offerings would please Jove and would convince Achilles to join the fight with them.</p>
    <p>Agamemnon sent Ulysses, Ajax, and two heralds to Achilles' tent, and told Achilles of all the offerings Agamemnon would give if Achilles would only fight with the Achaeans. These offerings included seven well-established cities, ten talents of gold, seven fresh tripods, one of Agamemnon's daughters, twelve strong horses, etc. Lots of stuff, including Briseis. Achilles turned it all down without hesitation.</p>
    <p>Pheonix then intervened and basically begged Achilles to fight. He told Achilles stories of great men gaining honour in fighting without getting anything in return. Even after hearing Pheonix, Achilles still would not fight. He said in the morning he'd leave in the ships with his men. Further, Achilles said his mother told him that if he was to fight in this battle, then he would surely die and be honoured. Achilles said he'd rather live a longer life, than live a short life, dying as a legend.</p>
    <p>Ulysses, Ajax and the two heralds told Agamemnon that Achilles would not fight. Nevertheless, the Achaean warriors decided to fight the Trojans in the morning regardless.</p>
