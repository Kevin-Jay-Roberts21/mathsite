  <p><b>Domain, Range and Functions</b></p>
  <p>A function $F$ is a rule that takes a number $x$ and assigns to it a unique (single) number $f(x)$.</p>
  <p>Examples: $f(x) = 3x - 2$ and $f(x) = x^2 + 1$</p>
  <p>The set of inputs (the number of $x$'s) are called the domain. The set of outputs (the number of output) are called the range.</p>
  <div style="border: solid 2px; padding: 10px;">
    <p><b>Example:</b> Find the domain and range of the following equation: $f(x) = x^3 + 1$</p>
    <div style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
    <p>We can plug in any $x$ and we will get an output. Therefore, the set of all real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, is the domain of $f(x)$. This can also be written as $(-\infty, \infty)$. However, it' better to specify that <u>all real numbers</u> are the domain. Later on we will end up seeing some cases where some specific $x$ values will not be allowed.</p>
    <p>The range of the equation is $(-\infty, \infty)$. Why? We know this because for whatever $x$ we plug in, there will be an output value. And this goes on to infinity. Here is a graph to easier see our function, the domain, and the range:</p>
