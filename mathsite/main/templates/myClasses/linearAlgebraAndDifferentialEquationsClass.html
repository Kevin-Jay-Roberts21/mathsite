  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Linear Algebra and Differential Equations: MATH 2250</h2>
  <div style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">
    <p>This class is obviously a combination of linear algebra and differential equations. I found this class quite useful and entertaining because of it's applied aspect. We did more than just examples on how to solve a DE. We  took time to understand what they mean.</p>
    <p>To start off, let's first go over some simple examples on how to solve linear vs. non-linear DE's (differential equations):</p>
    <div style="border: solid 2px; padding: 10px;">
      <p><b>Example:</b> Solve the first order, linear differential equation: $x' = t$</p>
      <div style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
      <p>Firstly, we know that $x' = \frac{dx}{dt}$. So let's rewrite as: $\frac{dx}{dt} = t$.</p>
      <p>After integrating both sides we get:</p>
      <p>$\int \frac{dx}{dt}dt = \int tdt \implies x(t) = \frac{1}{2}t^2 + C$</p>
      <p>$x(t) = \frac{1}{2}t^2 + C$ is our solution.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Let's try another, similar looking differential equation:</p>
    <div style="border: solid 2px; padding: 10px;">
      <p><b>Example:</b> Solve the first order, linear differential equation: $x' = x$</p>
      <div style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
      <p>Firstly, we know that $x' = \frac{dx}{dt}$. So let's rewrite as: $\frac{dx}{dt} = x$.</p>
      <p>Now we use an ODE method called separation of variables where we move all the same variables to one side of the equation. For our example, I'm going to move all the $x$'s to the left hand side of the equation:</p>
      <p>$\frac{1}{x}\frac{dx}{dt} = 1$. And now we integrate:</p>
      <p>$\int \frac{1}{x}\frac{dx}{dt}dt = \int 1dt \implies ln|x| = t + C$</p>
      <p>Now we exponentiate both sides: $e^{ln|x|} = e^{t + C} \implies x(t) = e^{t + C} = e^te^C = Ae^t$. Where $A$ is just another constant. Our final solution is:</p>
      <p>$x(t) = Ae^t$</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Now let's move on to another, more difficult example. This one is still linear however, it's second order because we have a variable inside where we take the second derivative of it.</p>
    <div style="border: solid 2px; padding: 10px;">
      <p><b>Example:</b> Solve the second order, linear differential equation: $x'' + 3x' + 2x = 6$</p>
      <div style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
      <p>There are a few ways to solve this second order differential equation. One of which is to just guess and check! Recall that our final solution is going to be a function $x(t) = blah$. We have to find $blah$ and $blah$ is what we will be guessing and checking for.</p>
      <p>You're probably thinking, "This is ridiculous! How am I suppose to just guess the solution of a very complicated equation?" To this I will say, by understanding derivatives. We need our function $x(t)$ to something where when we take a derivative, we don't get anything exponential. For example, $\sin(x)$. We could take the derivative of $\sin(x)$ 100 times and it wouldn't grow one bit. Another example of such a function would be $e^x$.</p>
      <p>Now, let's make a guess. By just looking at the problem, I'm going to guess $x(t) = 3$. If this were my guess, then x' = 0, and x'' = 0. Now after plugging everything in we get: $(0) + 3(0) + 2(3) = 6$. Wow! Lucky guess. Before moving on, I want to show that there are actually more solutions involving more in depth derivatives (using $\sin(x)$ or $e^x$).</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at the guess $x(t) = e^{-2t} \implies x' = -2e^{-2t} \implies x'' = 4e^{-2t}$.</p>
      <p>Now, plugging everything in we get:</p>
      <p>$(4e^{-2t}) + 3(-2e^{-2t}) + 2(e^{-2t}) = 6 \implies $</p>
      <p>$4e^{-2t} + -6e^{-2t} + 2e^{-2t} = 6 \implies 0 = 6$. Wrong! Thus, $e^{-2t}$ was an incorrect guess. But it was close! It looked like all we needed at the end was there to be $2(e^{-2t} + 3)$. Adding that plus 3 could be our solution. By modifying it slightly, let's try another guess:</p>
      <p>Guess is $x(t) = e^{-2t} + 3 \implies x' = -2e^{-2t} \implies x'' = 4e^{-2t}$</p>
      <p>Plug everything in:</p>
      <p>$(4e^{-2t}) + 3(-2e^{-2t}) + 2(e^{-2t} + 3) = 6 \implies $</p>
      <p>$4e^{-2t} + -6e^{-2t} + 2e^{-2t} + 6 = 6 \implies $</p>
      <p>$6e^{-2t} + -6e^{-2t} + 6 = 6 \implies 6 = 6$</p>
      <p>They are equal! Thus, $x(t) = e^{-2t} + 3$ is a possible solution and so is $x(t) = 3$.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This method of guessing and checking is not necessarily preferred because it could take a long time to guess the correct solution. There are other ways to solve the equation above where like finding a characteristic equation to a homogeneous solution and then adding that solution to a calculated particular solution. Later in the course we will get into this a little more in depth.</p>
    <p><b>First Order DEs</b></p>
    <p>A first order differential equation has the following form:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">$\frac{dy}{dt} = ay + q(t)$</p>
    <p>Where $t$ is time, $y$ is "typically" height but can be anything, $a$ is a constant, and $q(t)$ is simply just a function of one variable: $t$.</p>
    <p>There are a few methods on solving such a differential equation. Gilbert Strang derived an easy "plug and chug" solution for when the constant $a = 1$:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">$y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} e^{t-s}q(s)ds$&emsp;&emsp; solves &emsp;&emsp;$\frac{dy}{dt} = y + q(t)$</p>
    <p>To prove this, let's derive our defined $y(t)$ above:</p>
    <p>$\frac{dy}{dt} = e^t\int_{0}^{t}e^{-s}q(s)ds * e^t(e^{-t}q(t)) \implies \frac{dy}{dt} = y + q(t)$</p>
    <p>This method is a quick and fast way to solve the a first order differential equation when the constant $a$ is equal to one.</p>
    <p><b>Taylor Series Practice:</b></p>
    <p>This is a just a quick taylor series review. Let's let $f(t) = e^{3t}$ and let $a = 0$. Now let's solve for the Taylor series:</p>
    <p>$$\sum_{n=1}^{4} \frac{f^n(a)}{n!}(t - a)^n$$</p>
    <p>Plugging in some values, we get:</p>
    <p>$\frac{f'(0)}{1!}(t - 0)^1 + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}(t - 0)^2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}(t - 0)^3 + \frac{f''''(0)}{4!}(t - 0)^4 \implies$</p>
    <p>$\frac{3e^{3(0)}}{1}(t)^1 + \frac{9e^{3(0)}}{2}(t)^2 + \frac{27e^{3(0)}}{6}(t)^3 + \frac{81e^{3(0)}}{24}(t)^4 \implies$</p>
    <p>$3t + \frac{9}{2}t^2 + \frac{27}{6}t^3 + \frac{27}{8}t^4$</p>
    <p>This our taylor series approximation. Now let's talk a little bit about interest.</p>
    <p><b>Interest</b></p>
    <div style="border: solid 2px; padding: 10px;">
      <p><b>Example:</b> Solve the first order, linear differential equation: $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.05y$ with $y(0) = 100$</p>
      <p>From earlier calculations, we know how to solve this equation, this time I really want to break down every piece and treat it like a bank account. For this scenario, we can view $y(0) = 100$ as the initial amount of money in the bank. At time $0$, we have \$100 in the bank. Now what is the differential equation telling us? $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.05y$ is the rate of change of money in our bank account. 0.05 is the interest rate! Now let's solve the differential equation:</p>
      <p>$\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.05y \implies \frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.05 \implies $</p>
      <p>Integrate both sides: $\int\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dt}dt = \int0.05dt \implies ln|y| = 0.05t + C$</p>
      <p>Now exponentiate both sides: $e^{ln|y|} = e^{0.05t + C} \implies y = Ae^{0.05t}$</p>
      <p>Now that we have our solution, let's use the initial condition to solve for $C$:</p>
      <p>$100 = Ce^{0.005(0)} \implies C = 100$</p>
      <p>Thus our final solution is: $y(t) = 100e^{0.05t}$. To sum up, if we have a bank with an interest rate of 0.05 and we put in $100 at time $t = 0$, then we can use our solution to find out how much money we would have in say, 5 years:</p>
      <p>$y(5) = 100e^{0.05(5)} = 100e^{0.25} \approx \$128.40$</p>
