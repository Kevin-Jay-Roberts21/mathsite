# mathsite

This projcet is a website that I've created to help myself as well as all other students understand college level mathematics. This site contains personal notes taken from my past math classes at Utah State University. Furthermore, I've included other notes (in progress) on biological cell structure and research in hummingbirds and hummingbird activity/behavior.

Folders bin and lib are not written by me. They are essentially necessary packages to make the website function. Most everything written by me, opposed to the django defaulted python files, is in the mathsite/mathsite/ folder.
